# scrapping-website
scrapping ecommerce website using python
We'll get into each individual product page and retrieve our information from there. The website we are going to scrape â€“ it's an online shop that sells whisky.
I have gone to a subsection of the site here, and it looks like a there are quite a lot of choices. 
And if you want to find out what the user ratings are for every product, then you have to open each and every product page to get the ratings 
(you can't find them on the main page).
So we're going to get a list of all the links for every single product from all five pages. 
Then we are going to go into each product individually and scrape our desired data.
But some of them don't have a rating. Instead, in those cases, we'll go into each product and get the about text as well. Let's go!
